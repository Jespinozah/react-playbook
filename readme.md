## Why?
I believe the __Rails__ part of Ruby on Rails was what made it so popular and developer-friendly.

Conventions, patterns, rules, styles, etc reduce the mental load while you are developing. Instead of spending your decision-making energy on how best to perform a routine task, you can essentially go into auto-pilot mode, saving that energy for solving more interesting problems.

React Playbook is a collection of documents that attempts to give React its rails.

## Note
If you are new to React, looking through [petehunt/react-howto: Your guide to the (sometimes overwhelming!) React ecosystem.](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto) is recommended.
