## Why?
I believe one prominent reason Ruby on Rails became popular was that it was served on __rails__.

Conventions, patterns, rules, styles, etc reduce the mental load while you are developing. Instead of spending your decision-making energy on how best to perform a routine task, you can essentially go into auto-pilot mode, saving that energy for solving more interesting problems.

React Playbook attempts to give React its rails.
