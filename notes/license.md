# React's BSD-3 + License
There has been quite the uproar lately about React's (and other OSS Facebook projects') license agreement. I can see both sides of the argument, but I'm leaning towards the side that will avoid using these projects where possible, unfortunately.

*Update: Looks like Wordpress is [actively removing](https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/) their React usage*

Here are some good reads about it:

And some discussions on Twitter:

- "You know what would suck? If I invented a really cool new thing, patented it, implemented it in React, then Facebook decided to copy me"
