# React
## PropTypes
- Any props that are not required should have a defaultProp
  - [tweet](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/722128823706193920) from @sebmarkbage

## Refs
- Avoid using `refs` as much as possible
  - Why? Using refs makes the implementation more brittle. The `ref`d component can not be wrapped without custom logic.
  - Having a nested ref means that section of your render can not easily be refactored out into its own component.
- If you must use one (to get the dom node, for example), it must be to the top component in your render. __Don't ever use refs of a nested component.__ If you need the ref of a child, extract it out to its own component, then pass a prop/callback to it.
- DO NOT use string refs. All refs should use the callback style.
- DO NOT use `findDOMNode()`
  - use callback refs instead [abramov tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/752936646602031104)

## APIs
- Generic components that need broad customization should provide and act on a `render___` prop to override their default implementation.
  - e.g. Navbar's `title` (string) prop vs `renderTitle` (function (Component)) prop
- Only use `setState` iff it affects something that should be rerendered and it can not be computed from props.

## Perf
- Do not pass in Array or Object literals to subcomponents. If you do, PureRenderMixin will not work, since `['hi', 'bye'] !== ['hi', 'bye']`. Instead, move that array creation to an instance field or completely outside of the component. This means you should also define inline styles outside of your `render()`.
