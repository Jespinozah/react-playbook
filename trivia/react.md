# React
## Which props are auto-handled by React?
ref, key

## T/F: If shouldComponentUpdate returns false, its props are not updated
False. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mweststrate/status/783917485640810496)

## Why does React use `className` instead of `class`?
"Question to those who want to see <div className> become <div class>: is it not confusing that this breaks destructuring? https://t.co/HRKR3IkgRO" - [Dan Abramov on Twitter: ](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/890191815567175680)

# TODO: phrase with question
JSX will automatically remove whitespace on the beginning and ending of a line as well as blank lines. It also condenses blank lines in the middle of string literals into one space.
