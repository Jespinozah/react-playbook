# A Naming Convention for Immutable Components
An "Immutable Component" is a component that, after rendering once, can not re-render. i.e. it has `shouldComponentUpdate() { return false } `

*See [this](https://github.com/kylpo/react-playbook/blob/master/deep-dives/shouldComponentUpdate.md) writeup if you'd like more information on `shouldComponentUpdate`*

## Can You Spot Them?
Can you tell me which of these components do not re-render?

```jsx
<Col>
  <View padding={20}>
    <Text>Hi there</Text>
  </View>

  <Space size={20} />

  <Text style={styles.bye}>Bye bye now</Text>
</Col>
```

I canâ€™t either. I need prior knowledge of the components, or I need to read through their implementation.

## Introducing the `<IMMUTABLE>` Component Naming Convention

`<SPACE size={40} />` means we can optimize `scu => false`

`<DIV className={} />` would also be useful

Would love for React to handle this automatically. Just like react auto-handles lowercase components, it could handle UPPER_CASE components and PROPS.

# Notes to self
Immutable vs Constant:

Chose immutable because immutable can not change after initialized. `const` is a one-time assignment, but it can mutate. `const` would make more sense if you declared the component outside of your class, and used that `const` inside your `render()`.
